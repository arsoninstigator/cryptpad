# cryptpad ☆.ᐟ
cryptpad is my submission for the hack club ysws program called [hackpad (v2)](hackpad.hackclub.com) where we build our own custom macropads from end to end including brainstorming by making a rough sketch with an idea, planning the layout for your board + making a schematic, making a pcb based on the schematic, designing a printable case design on cad software and writing your own firmware to fit your needs.

## pcb (schematic + board)
**what i included:** xiao rp2040, 11 switches, rotary encoder, oled screen <br>
**software used:** kicad 8.99 (windows)
>you can find a preview of the schematic [here](demo/hackpad-schematic.png) and the pcb [here](demo/hackpad-pcb.png)

## case
i followed the hackpad case guide and referred to the v1 workshop recordings to build my very very rough case (that i do plan on improving) and my idea for the <ins>coffin shaped case</ins> and the overall dark theme of my macropad was largely inspired by an innate need to be edgy and a monster high phone case i saw on etsy (see below) <br><br>
