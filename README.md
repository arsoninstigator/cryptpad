# cryptpad ☆.ᐟ
cryptpad is my submission for the hack club ysws program called [hackpad (v2)](hackpad.hackclub.com) where we build our own custom macropads from end to end including brainstorming by making a rough sketch with an idea, planning the layout for your board + making a schematic, making a pcb based on the schematic, designing a printable case design on cad software and writing your own firmware to fit your needs.
