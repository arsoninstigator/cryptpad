# cryptpad ☆.ᐟ
> pcb for this was made in kicad 8.99, case was made on the fusion 360 educational plan (windows) & the firmware is written in kmk

cryptpad is my submission for the hack club ysws program called [hackpad (v2)](hackpad.hackclub.com) where we build our own custom macropads from end to end including brainstorming by making a rough sketch with an idea, planning the layout for your board + making a schematic, making a pcb based on the schematic, designing a printable case design on cad software and writing your own firmware to fit your needs.


## pcb (schematic + board)
<!-- **what i included:** xiao rp2040, 11 switches, rotary encoder, oled screen <br> -->
>you can find a preview of the schematic [here](renders/hackpad-schematic.png) and the pcb [here](renders/hackpad-pcb.png)

## case (bottom + top + knob)
i followed the hackpad case guide and referred to the v1 workshop recordings to build my very very rough case (that i do plan on improving) and my idea for the <ins>coffin shaped case</ins> and the overall dark theme of my macropad was largely inspired by an innate need to be edgy and a monster high phone case i saw on etsy (see [here](progress.md)) :3

## build process (inspiration + challenges)
my idea for the <ins>coffin shaped case</ins> and the overall dark theme of my macropad was largely inspired by an innate need to be edgy and a monster high phone case i saw on etsy (see [here](progress.md)) :3 i wanted my macropad to be a pastel goth draculaura (i have the same hair as her btw) themed combination of shortcuts that are most useful to me while i was working / relaxing on my computer

the most challenging part was finding the time to revamp the project from scratch again and again since i had some difficulty narrowing down which components i wanted to use and what i wanted my layout to look like. i have SO many hobbies and interests so it was hard for me to pick an aesthetic (im currently revamping this project yet again) and each time i created a new board, i started grasping some additional pcb/cad concepts, making me want to include even more advanced changes to my board :3 

i had to decide between a horror/gothic-y theme, a cute cat theme, a pastel theme, a detective/noir film theme and a pop-culture inspired theme. i wanted it to be consistent with my current vibes, interface with my current bedroom layout and be more neutral themed so i could even use it after the trends changed without being more queer/sapphic-y (that would out me) or more tech-y (boooo nerd !!!)
